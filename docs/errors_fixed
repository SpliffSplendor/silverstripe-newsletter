[2020-11-04 16:03:37] error-log.ERROR: Uncaught Exception Error: "Call to a member function setTitle() on null" at /var/www/html/vendor/silverstripe/newsletter/src/Form/GridField/NewsletterGridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest.php line 32 {"exception":"[object] (Error(code: 0): Call to a member function setTitle() on null at /var/www/html/vendor/silverstripe/newsletter/src/Form/GridField/NewsletterGridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest.php:32)"} []

Problem identified was the naming of the src/Form/GridField/NewsletterGridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest.php line 31:
$actions->fieldByName("action_doSave") this did return null and didn't initiate a recursive search.
$actions->fieldByName("MajorActions.action_doSave") does.

[2020-11-05 17:24:28] error-log.ERROR: Object->__call(): the method 'addCustomHeader' does not exist on 'SilverStripe\Newsletter\Control\Email\NewsletterEmail' {"exception":"[object] (BadMethodCallException(code: 0): Object->__call(): the method 'addCustomHeader' does not exist on 'SilverStripe\\Newsletter\\Control\\Email\\NewsletterEmail' at /sites/cinescuela/www/vendor/silverstripe/framework/src/Core/CustomMethods.php:54)"} []

Method addCustomHeader is not part of the NewsletterEmail class or its parents, called in src/Model/SendRecipientQueue.php line 82
    $email->addCustomHeader('Reply-To', $newsletter->ReplyTo);
Because it's the only occurrence and is used for setting the Reply-To header, we can use
    $email->setReplyTo($newsletter->ReplyTo);
instead.
